# 👋 Hi, I’m Guillaume Corlouer

I am currently an independent researcher in AI safety. I am interested in interpretability and applying methods from information theory and complex systems to discover latent variables from neural activations that we can leverage for AI safety.

Previously, I was a research affiliate at Principle of Intelligence and Behavior in Biological and Social systems ([PIBBSS](https://pibbss.ai/)), where I worked on singular learning theory and explored the application of information theory for lie detection in LLMs.

I completed my PhD at the University of Sussex under the supervision of Lionel Barnett and Anil Seth, working on estimating information flow between different regions of the brain during visual perception to empirically investigate predictive coding.

# 👀 I’m interested in ...

I am passionate and fascinated by the complex, flexible and optimized functioning of the brain that is 
yet left to be understood and characterized. I am particularly interested in studying the neural computational
theories at the basis of information processing, learning and memory formation in neuronal networks. 
I am interested in answering questions such as: How is information from the environment represented by ensembles of neurons?
How do the neural networks evolve with learning? 
How does the brain create, store, and update memories for places and events? 
I am looking forward to making advances in answering these questions, working at the intersection between
theoretical neuroscience research and machine learning. It is my conviction that working on both artificial
and biological neural networks in parallel will enable us to move forward faster in the general understanding of their mechanisms.
