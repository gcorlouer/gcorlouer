# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Guillaume Corlouer

I am currently an independent researcher in AI safety. I am interested in interpretability and applying methods from information theory and complex systems to discover latent variables from neural activations that we can leverage for AI safety.

Previously, I was a research affiliate at Principle of Intelligence and Behavior in Biological and Social systems ([PIBBSS](https://pibbss.ai/)), where I worked on singular learning theory and explored the application of information theory for lie detection in LLMs.

I completed my PhD at the University of Sussex under the supervision of Lionel Barnett and Anil Seth, working on estimating information flow between different regions of the brain during visual perception to empirically investigate predictive coding.

# ü§ñ What I'm currently working on
I am investigating the application of multivariate information-theoretic measures of emergences like [dynamical independence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06511) to discover useful latent variables from the activation of autoregressive deep neural networks in a data-driven way. I am particularly excited to leverage these methods to discover belief-states from the activations that are [predicted](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gTZ2SxesbHckJ3CkF/transformers-represent-belief-state-geometry-in-their) by Crutchfield's computational mechanics.
